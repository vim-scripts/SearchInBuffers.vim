This plugin allow you to search the current search pattern in all the buffers currently opened into VIM.

Just do a search in whatsoever way into the current buffer and then run :SIB to process the same search in all the other open buffers.

Use the quickfix commands (:cn, :cp, ...) to navigate through the patterns found, :cclose to close the found's list, that's all.

Do ':help quickfix.txt' for more details.
